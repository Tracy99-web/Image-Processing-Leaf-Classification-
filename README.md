# Image-Processing-Leaf-Classification-
This image processing project focuses on detecting and classifying different leaf types: mint, tulsi, guava, and rose apple. Using advanced image recognition techniques, we analyse leaf characteristics  and leverage features such as shape, texture, and colour to accurately differentiate between these plant species.
